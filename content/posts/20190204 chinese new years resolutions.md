One of my calendar new year goals was to finally, finally build a personal website. 

If you're reading this, I'm happy to report that it's been checked off the list.

So, then what? Well, seeing as I had made adequate progress towards my annual resolutions by mid-January, I immediately backslid and got caught up in the all-too-escapable wave of tedium that defines modern life. Long work weeks, bingeing a Netflix show I don't even *like*, a brief but gripping Stardew Valley addiction... but hey! It's the new year again, albeit the lunar one, so we're putting that all behind for a second fresh start.

Today, I wanted to share some of my 2019 hopes, wishes and dreams-- turned into quantitative inputs for a radar graph and spreadsheet dashboard, of course.


### Liane's Wheel of Life

The "wheel of life," I believe, is a cosmic Buddhist symbol that some guru repurposed into a time management concept, which I subsequently heard about on Reddit and repurposed towards my personal life.

Here she is.

Essentially, I create categories as needed to try and identity the areas of my life I want to bring into balance. Once or twice a year, I'll re-evaluate where I stand on an extremely subjective 1 to 5 scale and see what parts I want to focus more attention on. The idea isn't necessarily to strive for all 5's, but to reduce some of the whiplash or anxiety I get when my fun v. finances, career v. community, relationship v. family, etc. are at different extremes. Looking at it now, I'm able to recognize some of my achievements I might not have noticed otherwise, and it also helps to alleviate comparisons to other people/perfectionism because all I'm really trying to do is be the best version of myself. Cheers to gamification.

### 2019 Resolutions

When I'm writing out goals, the wheel also helps me make sure I'm not leaving anything out. I'll spare you the [full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSNzM3dwc7IbWiRVZwHdNABg3MT4EOMYOlxweIa9S3A/edit?usp=sharing), but I love to color code them and break them into overarching resolutions. These are mine:

1. **Become the person my teenage self dreamed of growing up into.** (Learning, Spirit)
2. **Take professional risks.** (Career)
3. **Make Chicago feel like home.** (Community, Fun)

That's it for now.

Wish me luck!
