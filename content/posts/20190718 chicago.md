Hey.

I'm moving at the end of the month. I'm finding a new home again.

To everyone, myself included, this was entirely unexpected. Chicago's not a cold city (metaphorically, not literally! _duh!_) but it has its distances, its special rhythms that keep you at a remove. Segregate neighborhoods, secret societies, half-years spent hidden away in parka coats and underground tunnels. After two years here, the ice was just starting to thaw, and I'll miss it. I'll miss it a lot. But it's not too hard to say goodbye.
