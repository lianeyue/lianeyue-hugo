I believe in service leadership, in creating opportunities for myself and for others, and in embracing creative chances. 

Right now, I consult with [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/) to drive technology transformation through IT strategy, architecture and infrastructure. Before that, I managed ERP and CRM deployments at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/en) and [Telamon](https://www.telamon.com/). I've worked across the healthcare, automotive and utilities industries (to name a few) and developed skills in UI/UX, project management, and supply chain process improvement. I'm known to team members as an effective, enthusiastic "ray of sunshine" who always stockpiles snacks to share.

I studied Information Systems at the [Kelley School of Business](https://www.kelley.iu.edu/) and am now based in Chicago, though my work often takes me around the country. On the road, I enjoy exchanging postcards, working on screenplays, and practicing my Chinese and French. When I'm home, I volunteer with resettled families at [RefugeeOne](http://www.refugeeone.org).

Thanks for stopping by, and [let's connect](mailto:liane.yue@gmail.com?subject:Hello!)! I'd love to meet a future friend, collaborator, or pen pal. 

Kind regards,<br>
*Liane*
