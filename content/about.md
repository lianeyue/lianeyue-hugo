I believe in service leadership, in creating opportunities for myself and for others, and in embracing creative chances. Right now, I consult with [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/) to drive technology transformation for clients through strategy, architecture and infrastructure. Before that, I had marvelous experiences managing ERP and CRM deployments at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/en) and [Telamon](https://www.telamon.com/). I've worked across the life sciences, automotive and utilities industries (to name a few) and developed skills in project management, supply chain process improvement and user experience. I'm also known to team members as an effective, enthusiastic "ray of sunshine" that always brings the good snacks.

I studied Information Systems at the [Indiana University Kelley School of Business](https://www.kelley.iu.edu/) and am now based in the Chicago area, though my work often takes me around the country. On the road, I enjoy exchanging postcards, working on screenplays, and practicing my Chinese and French. When I'm home, I volunteer through [RefugeeOne](http://www.refugeeone.org) and [GirlSpace](https://www.girlscoutsgcnwi.org/en/donate/girlspace.html).

Thanks for stopping by, and [let's connect](mailto:liane.yue@gmail.com?subject:Hello!)! I'd love to meet a future friend, collaborator, or pen pal. 

Kind regards,<br>
*Liane*
