      <description>I took a film class called &amp;ldquo;Screenwriting 101&amp;rdquo; at Second City this spring. The instructor was brilliant. They were great at breaking down the elements of film/TV, explaining writing room dynamics, and advising us on the &amp;ldquo;behind the scenes&amp;rdquo; business skills needed to make it. But what I was most impressed with was their patience and ability to tailor their message to everyone in the room, which was a small and super diverse microcosm of Chicago.</description>

      <description>One of my calendar new year goals was to finally, finally build a personal website.
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that it&amp;rsquo;s been checked off the list.
So, then what? Well, seeing as I had made adequate progress towards my annual resolutions by mid-January, I immediately backslid and got caught up in the all-too-escapable wave of tedium that defines modern life. Long work weeks, bingeing a Netflix show I don&amp;rsquo;t even like, a brief but gripping Stardew Valley addiction&amp;hellip; but hey!</description>

      <description>I believe in service leadership, in creating opportunities for myself and for others, and in embracing creative chances.
Right now, I consult with Ernst &amp;amp; Young to drive technology transformation through IT strategy, architecture and infrastructure. Before that, I managed ERP and CRM deployments at GE Healthcare and Telamon. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked across the healthcare, automotive and utilities industries (to name a few) and developed skills in UI/UX, project management, and supply chain process improvement.</description>
